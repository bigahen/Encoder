# Encryptor
- Basic implementation of public-key cryptography using the Java programming environment. 
- The encryption algorithm used is non-optimal and would be easily reverse-engineered. 

For use, generate new set of keys for yourself. 
For encryption, use your private key and the reciever's public key.
For decryption, use your private key and the sender's public key.
